## Overview of Approach

I opted for Nestjs as a framework because of the following;

1. The structure and organization it brings with inbuilt controller, module and service.
2. The easily implementation of decorators
3. The OOP principles it follows.

## Interesting Challenges

1. My only challenge was deploying the Nest app because most cloud services that can easily deploy nestjs apps are not free so i opted for Render.com

## Aspects I am proud of

I am generally proud of the organization of my code, the frequent commenting to explain some parts that may need clearance and the way I utilized helper functions (reusable functions).

And if I had more time, I would have implemented a more robust caching system and testing feature

## Swagger Doc

1. Install the app with `npm install`
2. Run the app with `npm run start:dev`
3. Open the swagger documentation on your browser with `http://localhost:3500/api/docs#/`

## How to Run

1. Install the app with `npm install`
2. Run the app with `npm run start:dev`
3. The `x-project-header` value is "abc" and most be present for all subsequent requests
